# Tweepy
This project scrapes tweets using tweepy (Twitter API) by geographic location. This is a streaming data. Further the tweets from India are considered for sentiment analysis using TextBlob. The data recieved is stored locally in a database and in a csv file which is uploaded as google sheet and thus is updated every hour using Coupler.io . Finally datawrapper is used to make choropleth map of India.
